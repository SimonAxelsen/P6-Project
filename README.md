## Overview

Lost Translation is an adaptive storyworld game designed for adult learners with no prior Portuguese experience. Rather than relying on flashcards or grammar drills, the game embeds target vocabulary within an interactive narrative where players acquire language naturally through context, repetition, and problem-solving.

## Core Concept

The game explores **implicit learning**—absorbing vocabulary through contextualized exposure without direct instruction. Players navigate a dynamic environment where Portuguese words are encountered in meaningful situations, supported by visual cues, diglot weave (mixed-language dialogue), and interactive elements that reinforce meaning through gameplay.

## Design Pillars

- **Adaptive narrative**: Story responds to player actions while maintaining coherence
- **Contextual inference**: Vocabulary meaning derived from situation and visual scaffolding
- **Interactive problem-solving**: Puzzles require dialogue revisitation and word experimentation

### Qualitative Findings

- Game rated as **more engaging and less mentally fatiguing**
- **Contextual inference** emerged as dominant learning strategy
- Narrative context + positive framing acted as learning scaffolds

## Status

Completed as a bachelor project (P6) at Aalborg University (2025). Prototype demonstrates pedagogical viability of implicit, narrative-driven language acquisition.
